# thezombsproject
A public, open-source, zombs.io script project, planning many features. Work in progress.

## Install Guide:

1. Install a UserScript manager if you have not already (Tampermonkey recommended, not sure if it works on others).
2. Download script.user.js, it should prompt an install menu in the Chrome extension. Click install.
3. You are done!
